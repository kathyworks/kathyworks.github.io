But just for the sake of succinctness, I am listing what I currently use in this project for reference:\\n\\n* **macOS**\\n<br/>(Windows or Linux would work just as well here)\\n* **Terminal**\\n* **Visual Studio Code**\\n* [Optional] A clicky mechanical keyboard\\n\\n## Tone ##\\n\\nWhilst this series is essentially just me documenting my own steps, I decided to type everything out as if I am instructing another developer (perhaps you?) on how to do it-just so the chapters will flow more naturally.\\n\\nLet\'s dive right in.\\n\\n## Creating a NodeJS Application ##\\n\\nLet\'s start by building out a backend first. In our case, it will be a NodeJS app.\\n\\nIf you are reading this series, chances are you would already have NodeJS and npm installed. To check the versions you have, type this command in Terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\nnode -v && npm -v\\n```\\n\\nIn case NodeJS has not been installed on your local machine yet, it can be downloaded from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).\\n\\nWhen you install NodeJS this way, npm will automatically get installed as well.\\n\\n### Folder Structure ###\\n\\nMy preferred top-level project folder structure is as follows, where \\"Kathy Works\\" is the name of my blog:\\n\\n```bash\\n~/kathy_works\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /backend/\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 /frontend/\\n```\\n\\nFeel free to name your own project anything you want.\\n\\nIn this chapter, I\'ll only be working on the `/backend/` part. We will get to the `/frontend/` in future chapters.\\n\\nTo create the desired folders:\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir kathy_works\\ncd kathy_works\\nmkdir backend\\ncd backend\\n```\\n\\n### package.json ###\\n\\nIn modern node development, a `package.json` file is crucial for installing node packages in the project.\\n\\nTo scaffold the `/backend/` with a default `package.json`, run the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm init -y\\n```\\n\\n### .gitignore ###\\n\\nA `.gitignore` is highly recommended if you use git for version control. As its name suggests, files and folders listed in the `.gitignore` file will be ignored by the GitHub repository.\\n\\nThe dot in front of the filename means the file is a hidden one.\\n\\n## Installing Packages ##\\n\\nFor this project, we will be installing several necessary packages:\\n\\n* **Express**<br/>\\nThe NodeJS framework we\'ll use to create API endpoints, which will act as communicative bridges between our frontend and our database.\\n\\n* **Mongoose**<br/>\\nA package for us to connect to our MongoDB database.\\n\\n* **Dotnev**<br/>\\nIt is commonly used to store project secrets or special configurations that we do not want to go onto a live database.\\n\\n* **Nodemon**<br/>\\nA great development tool, which is capable of restarting our backend server as soon as we make any changes in the codebase.\\n\\nTo install the first 3 packages, run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm i express mongoose dotenv\\n```\\n\\nAs for `nodemon`, since we won\'t need it in production, we will install it as a dev dependency via the `--save-dev` flag:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm i --save-dev nodemon\\n```\\n\\nNow if we open up `package.json`, we should see that the packages have been installed appropriately in either \\"dependencies\\" or \\"devDependencies\\".\\n\\n```json\\n\\"dependencies\\": {\\n    \\"dotenv\\": \\"^16.4.5\\",\\n    \\"express\\": \\"^4.19.2\\",\\n    \\"mongoose\\": \\"^8.4.5\\"\\n},\\n\\"devDependencies\\": {\\n    \\"nodemon\\": \\"^3.1.4\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Running the Project ##\\n\\nThe default main javascript file in `package.json` is `index.js`. However, the more common convention in backend node development is to name it `server.js`, so we\'ll create it and give it just one line (for now) in Visual Studio Code:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconsole.log(\\"Hello world! I am your server.\\");\\n```\\n\\nNext, in `package.json`, update the `\\"main\\"` and `\\"scripts\\"` sections accordingly to reflect our changes:\\n\\n```json\\n\\"main\\": \\"server.js\\",\\n```\\n\\n```json\\n\\"scripts\\": {\\n    \\"start\\": \\"node server.js\\",\\n    \\"dev\\": \\"nodemon server.js\\"\\n},\\n```\\n\\nAt this point, our folder structure should look similar to this:\\n\\n```bash\\n/kathy_works\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /backend\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 /node_modules/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package-lock.json\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 /frontend/\\n```\\n\\nAs we are just getting started, we are not quite ready to deploy our code to production yet.\\n\\nLet\'s run in development for the time being. In Terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\nIf everything works properly, you should see:\\n\\n```bash\\n[nodemon] starting `node server.js`\\nHello world! I am your server.\\n```\\n\\nCongratulations!\\n\\n## Next Up ##\\n\\nIn the next chapter, we will create an Express server, which will contain our routes and controllers.\\n\\nUntil next time!"},{"id":"multimillion-dollar-businesses-for-grabs","metadata":{"permalink":"/multimillion-dollar-businesses-for-grabs","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-24-multimillion-dollar-businesses-for-grabs/index.md","title":"$10M+ Businesses for Grabs","description":"There is just one small catch.","date":"2024-01-24T22:39:21.000Z","formattedDate":"January 24, 2024","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"multimillion-dollar-businesses-for-grabs","title":"$10M+ Businesses for Grabs","date":"2024-01-24 22:39:21 +0800","image":"./multimillion-dollar-businesses-for-grabs_cover-photo.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Building a full-stack MERN web app: [Ch. 1] The\xa0setup","permalink":"/building-fullstack-mern-web-app-01"},"nextItem":{"title":"Making a Card Game \u2014 The Why","permalink":"/making-a-card-game-the-why"}},"content":"<small>There is just one small catch.</small>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nAs I peruse industry news every day and repeatedly feel heavy-hearted for talented folks who are impacted by rounds after rounds of layoffs, two questions linger in my mind:\\n\\nA. Where are humanity\u2019s key roles shifting toward in the age of AI?\\n\\nB. What can I do to be of service to people who are impacted?\\n\\nWhile I don\u2019t have definitive answers for (A) yet, I have a proposition for (B).\\n\\n## I am hoarding high-value businesses ##\\n\\nThere are many things in life I am admittedly bad at... And yet, I happen to be a \u201cstartup machine.\u201d\\n\\nFriends and acquaintances alike know me as someone who can build minimum viable products (MVPs) as efficiently as getting an oil change over the lunch break. These days, having an MVP is often all you need to raise venture capitalist (VC) funding, grow a customer base, or even generate profits!\\n\\nI am also an \u201cidea machine.\u201d\\n\\nAll the MVPs I\u2019ve built so far stem from my original ideas. And new ideas keep popping up in my head every day, which will likely continue to for a long time to come.\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s see: There\u2019s no short supply of business ideas. I possess the skills to quickly and effectively build out their prototypes. So what\u2019s one thing that\u2019s standing in the way of their success? The answer is me.\\n\\n## Why am I giving out the businesses? ##\\n\\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to speculate that these businesses will only reach their full potential (earning or otherwise) if they are run by a dedicated CEO.\\n\\nAs a two-thumbed person in this one universe, I cannot be that CEO for every single one of these high-potential businesses. This is where you may come into the picture.\\n\\nDespite the valuation, there is no guarantee that each of these businesses will indeed yield multimillion dollars in cash. All we know is that, idling them or putting them on the back burner indefinitely means they will remain ZERO-dollar businesses for sure.\\n\\nThese high-potential businesses need the care and attention they deserve.\\n\\n## What exactly are the businesses? ##\\n\\nMostly tech startups in the realms of software-as-a-service (SaaS), ecommerce, games, robotics, internet of things (IoT), and many more. There\u2019s a bunch of \u201ctraditional\u201d businesses I\u2019ve built as well, which may also be put on the to-give list.\\n\\nOver the coming months, I will pick out the exact startups to give away from my repository, one after another \u2014 so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for updates if you\u2019re interested.\\n\\n## What\u2019s involved? ##\\n\\nOne new CEO will be selected for each of the startups I am about to give away. Said CEO will work closely with me to ensure a smooth transition, before taking on post-MVP executive responsibilities.\\n\\nThe work will be remote, or at least the part between us will be. This way I don\u2019t have to limit the location. After the transfer, it\u2019s up to the new CEO to decide whether they want the company to remain distributed.\\n\\nFor each startup, the CEO will form a C Corporation in a State of their choosing. In most cases, the C Corp will be co-owned by my main company, Buildiful (also a C Corp).\\n\\nThe reason behind this co-owning arrangement is simple: I am passionate about the business (hence why it was born in the first place), and would like to be a part of its growth, at least at the beginning.\\n\\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the CEO does not necessarily have to be a US citizen \u2014 I\u2019m not.\\n\\n## Should you jump on board? ##\\n\\nIf your answer to one of the following is \u201cyes,\u201d you should consider counting yourself in:\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>You are recently impacted by layoffs, and is currently funemployed.</li>\\n\\n<li>You are looking for a new, exciting opportunity.</li>\\n\\n<li>You are interested in being a startup CEO (with or without prior experience) and running your company to your best abilities.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n## What\u2019s the catch? ##\\n\\nInitially, there will be no monthly salary. Starting out, I will not be on the payroll either.\\n\\nBut the nice thing is, the MVP has already been built, so that\u2019s a huge (if not the biggest) chunk of costs eliminated.\\n\\nSome of the businesses on my list (for example, a STEM card game business, a SaaS, etc.) are already bringing in revenues, so they may be slightly easier to work with. It all comes down to how much buffer you have at this point in time, and how big of a challenge you think you can take on.\\n\\nAs far as whether to bootstrap the startup or to raise external funding, it\u2019s something we can discuss on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\n## When will this start? ##\\n\\nAt the time of this post, I am in the home stretch of launching an AI product.\\n\\nI will have more time to disclose more details after the launch. Once again, stay tuned for updates.\\n\\nOn a related note, I have no immediate plans to put this AI product on the to-give list just yet, since it\u2019s at a stage where it still requires a lot of my attention. That\u2019s not to say circumstances won\u2019t change in the future. We\u2019ll see.\\n\\n## What will the future hold? ##\\n\\nTo dive back more into my original question (A), short of a definitive answer, I have an inkling.\\n\\nI firmly believe that we have entered an Innovative Revolution, where there will be a surge of unique business ideas being executed all around the globe.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not that people didn\u2019t have innovative ideas before. It\u2019s just that, following the AI Revolution, it\u2019s now easier than ever to build prototypes with the help of AI. Testing one\u2019s ideas now costs significantly less. Opportunity costs are also remarkably lower.\\n\\nIt\u2019s possible SMEs and self employment will gradually become the norm. As Innovative Revolution continues, working for someone else will become less and less commonplace \u2014 at least as far as the tech industry is concerned.\\n\\nBut that\u2019s just my two cents.\\n\\n## Lastly... ##\\n\\nOn the cusp of change, these are challenging times. Whether or not we end up working together on this initiative, please remember to keep your head up. When one door closes, another opens. And then another. And another. I am eager to see if I can hold the door open for some of you this time. But if not, I\u2019m sure you are more than capable of opening it yourself just fine.\\n\\nSpeak again soon!"},{"id":"making-a-card-game-the-why","metadata":{"permalink":"/making-a-card-game-the-why","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-01-making-a-card-game-the-why/index.md","title":"Making a Card Game \u2014 The Why","description":"Summary: Introducing an analog card game I created, which features logic gates.","date":"2023-06-01T18:18:21.000Z","formattedDate":"June 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"zero and won","permalink":"/tags/zero-and-won"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"making-a-card-game-the-why","title":"Making a Card Game \u2014 The Why","date":"2023-06-01 18:18:21 +0800","image":"./zero-and-won_cover-photo.png","tags":["zero and won"]},"prevItem":{"title":"$10M+ Businesses for Grabs","permalink":"/multimillion-dollar-businesses-for-grabs"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building the Front End","permalink":"/building-front-end"}},"content":"<small>Summary: Introducing an analog card game I created, which features logic gates.</small>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nI am a stalwart puzzle game nerd. If you are still reading on after that first statement, you and I are <i>destined to be friends</i> forever.\\n\\nNow that we are <i>best friends</i>, I\u2019d like for you to meet two of my other besties, Solitaire and Sudoku.\\n\\nThose two are both pleasantly straightforward, to me at least. I find playing with them \u2014 I mean playing them \u2014 relaxing. There is ever only one final configuration in each round, so there won\u2019t be any surprises in the end \u2014 unlike, say, going to the mechanics for the first time in years.\\n\\nAnd with Solitaire, there is this extra layer of the luck element. Not all rounds are winnable, which in a sense reflects how life is. You win some; you lose some.\\n\\nBecause <i>we are family</i>, let me let you in on a little secret. I\u2019ve always wanted to create a unique card game that shares similar fabric with the aforementioned pair.\\n\\nThe logic gate card game idea first came to me in late September, 2021. Whilst casually working out the specifics inside my head, I also thought of a name for the game \u2014 \u201cZero And Won.\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s a play on words on how the game would involve the binary digits, zero and one. Additionally, the rough idea was that whoever first played all of their cards (with zero cards left) would win. \u201cOne\u201d and \u201cwon\u201d sound identical, too.\\n\\nI understand every expecting parent must want me to name their baby now. Since I <i>hardly know you at all</i> though, I unfortunately won\u2019t be able to offer discount prices for my name consulting services.\\n\\nBut I digress. Back to the name of the game, both figuratively and literally. Being a self-professed domain name hoarder, I went ahead and registered `zeroandwon.com` right away.\\n\\n![alt text](./zero-and-won_domain-registration.png)\\n\\nHowever, at the time, a bunch of other time-sensitive projects left me with not much capacity to move forward with Zero And Won. The launch plan would not proceed until mid-Q2 of 2023, which is essentially when I started documenting the project publicly as well \u2014 including this blog you are reading now.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n<b className=\\"pink-text\\">From:</b> Kathy Li<br/>\\n<b className=\\"pink-text\\">To:</b> Kathy Li<br/>\\n<b className=\\"pink-text\\">Subject:</b> Go for it<br/>\\n<b className=\\"pink-text\\">Date:</b> October 10, 2021, 10:10 AM<br/><br/>\\n\\n```html\\nScheduled to send on May 1, 2023, 12:00 AM\\n```\\n\\nHey 2023 you,\\n\\nGood job surviving 2021 and 2022.

Feel free to replace `~/Development` with your preferred directory.\\n\\n```bash\\ncd ~/Development\\n`````````\\n\\nThen I ran the following command to create an app named `final-static`. All of the project files would be generated inside the `final-static` folder.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-next-app final-static\\n`````````\\n\\nIf you didn\'t already have it, you would be asked to install the `create-next-app` package first.\\n\\nWhen the command completed, I changed into the newly created project directory.\\n\\n```bash\\ncd final-static\\n```\\n\\nThe next step would be to install the dependencies using a package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.\\n\\nI tried both `npm` and `yarn`, and it appeared that `yarn` worked better for my particular setup. Feel free to pick whichever works better for you:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle \\\\\\nethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers \\\\\\nweb3modal @openzeppelin/contracts ipfs-http-client \\\\\\naxios\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn add ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle \\\\\\nethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers \\\\\\nweb3modal @openzeppelin/contracts ipfs-http-client \\\\\\naxios\\n```\\n\\nYou might also need to follow the prompts to troubleshoot any warnings or errors.\\n\\n## Setting up Tailwind CSS ##\\n\\nWhen it comes to customizing web-based user interfaces, I like the full control you get with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), but honestly dread having to put in the sometimes counter-intuitive work just to get things to look good enough (let alone perfect).\\n\\nIf you are in the same boat as far as CSS is concerned, then you might also find Tailwind CSS helpful.\\n\\n> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you the building blocks you need to add styling and create good-looking designs the easy way.\\n\\nHere\'s the command I used to install the Tailwind dependencies:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest\\n```\\n\\nThen, in order to create the configuration files needed for Tailwind to work with Next.js (namely, `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`), I ran:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\\n```\\n\\nWith said configuration files generated, I was able to make some preliminary updates.\\n\\nTo add custom template content paths in `tailwind.config.js`:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// tailwind.config.js\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  content: [\\n    \\"./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\\",\\n    \\"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\\",\\n  ],\\n  theme: {\\n    extend: {},\\n  },\\n  plugins: [],\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe next thing I did was replacing the code in `styles/globals.css` with the following:\\n\\n```javascript\\n@tailwind base;\\n@tailwind components;\\n@tailwind utilities;\\n```\\n\\n## Configuring Hardhat ##\\n\\nOne distinctive characteristic of decentralized applications (dapps) is the use of blockchain technology with smart contract functionality.\\n\\nThe blockchain platform of choice here is Ethereum. To support this, I went ahead and set up Hardhat.\\n\\n> Hardhat is a Solidity development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software.\\n\\n> Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms \u2014 most notably \u2014 Ethereum.\\n\\nI started by initializing a new Hardhat development environment from the root of the `/final-static` project:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx hardhat\\n```\\n\\nAt the prompt, I selected:\\n\\n```bash\\n? What do you want to do?\\n> Create a basic sample project\\n```\\n\\nWhen asked about the project root, I went with the default. Your directories would be different.\\n\\n```bash\\n? Hardhat project root: > /Users/kathy/Development/final-static\\n```\\n\\nAfter saying \\"yes\\" to adding a `.gitignore`, I got a possibly git-related error:\\n\\n```bash\\nError HH16: The directory /Users/kathy/Development/final-static contains files that could conflict:\\n\\n  README.md\\n\\nEither try using a new directory, or remove the files listed above.\\n```\\n\\nAnd therefore I deleted `README.md` and ran the initialization again.\\n\\n```bash\\nrm README.md\\nnpx hardhat\\n```\\n\\nWhen the initialization completed, I quickly checked to make sure the following files and folders were successfully generated in the project root directory:\\n\\n* `hardhat.config.js`\\n\\nThe entirety of your Hardhat setup (i.e. your config, plugins, and custom tasks) is contained in this file.\\n\\n* `/scripts/`\\n\\nA folder containing a script named sample-script.js that will deploy your smart contract when executed.\\n\\n* `/test/`\\n\\nA folder containing an example testing script.\\n\\n* `/contracts/`\\n\\nA folder holding an example Solidity smart contract.\\n\\nNext, per Nader\'s tutorial, I updated the configuration at `hardhat.config.js` by replacing the auto-generated code with the following:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// hardhat.config.js\\nrequire(\\"@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle\\")\\n\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  defaultNetwork: \\"hardhat\\",\\n  networks: {\\n    hardhat: {\\n      chainId: 1337\\n    },\\n//  Unused configuration. Commented out for now.\\n//  TODO: Test Mumbai network\\n//  mumbai: {\\n//    url: \\"https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com\\",\\n//    accounts: [process.env.privateKey]\\n//  }\\n  },\\n  solidity: {\\n    version: \\"0.8.4\\",\\n    settings: {\\n      optimizer: {\\n        enabled: true,\\n        runs: 200\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe above configured the local Hardhat development environment as well as the Mumbai testnet (commented out for now until I got ready for the test).\\n\\nThey are both Polygon (formerly Matic) networks.\\n\\n> Polygon makes Web3 more accessible. It is a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform that enables developers to build scalable user-friendly dapps with low transaction fees.\\n\\nLet\'s break things up here for now. In the next post, I will proceed to set up smart contracts."},{"id":"set-up-environment-to-build-full-stack-dapp","metadata":{"permalink":"/set-up-environment-to-build-full-stack-dapp","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-30-set-up-environment-to-build-full-stack-dapp/index.md","title":"Configuring Development Environment to Build Full-Stack Dapps","description":"Web3 Code Experiment: Part 3","date":"2022-03-30T17:18:21.000Z","formattedDate":"March 30, 2022","tags":[{"label":"final static","permalink":"/tags/final-static"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"set-up-environment-to-build-full-stack-dapp","title":"Configuring Development Environment to Build Full-Stack Dapps","date":"2022-03-30 17:18:21 +0800","tags":["final static"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Dapp Project Setup","permalink":"/dapp-project-setup"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Hook Up Custom Domain Emails to Free Gmail Account","permalink":"/set-up-custom-domain-emails-free"}},"content":"<small>Web3 Code Experiment: Part 3</small>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nOne nice thing about building full-stack applications from scratch is the flexibility. You are not limited to any one fixed set of tools, and can therefore go the pragmatic route of selecting:\\n\\na. What suits the job best\\n\\nb. What you are most familiar with\\n\\nc. A mix of the above  \\n\\nThat said, because I am building my first-ever decentralized application (dapp), it would probably make more sense to reference what experienced dapp developers have already done rather than completely reinventing the wheels. With that in mind, I\'ve decided to follow Nader Dabit\'s [tutorial](https://dev.to/edge-and-node/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb) to build out the skeletal structure, making minor modifications as necessary.\\n\\nAccording to Nader, this is the list of tools I would need:\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n* Node.js version `16.14.0` or greater\\n* MetaMask digital wallet installed as a browser extension\\n\\n### The Stack:\\n* Web application framework - Next.js\\n* Solidity development environment - Hardhat\\n* File storage - IPFS\\n* Ethereum web client library - Ethers.js\\n\\nAnd just to avoid ambiguity, I should also list the below.\\n\\n### Operating System:\\nmacOS (This is not a requirement at all. It just happens to be what I primarily use as a hybrid app developer.)\\n\\nNow, time to jump right in!\\n\\n## Upgrading Node.js ##\\n\\nA quick version check on Terminal showed that I needed a newer Node installation.\\n\\n```bash\\nnode -v\\nv12.13.0\\n```\\n\\nSince I already had Homebrew installed, at first I figured I would just upgrade Node via Homebrew.\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew update\\nbrew doctor\\nbrew cleanup\\nbrew upgrade node\\nbrew link --overwrite node\\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local\\nbrew postinstall node\\n```\\n\\nBut then as I was troubleshooting some errors, I came across several articles which pointed out that nvm might be a more suitable choice for my project. For example, this [article](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/) said:\\n\\n> Using nvm (Node.js Version Manager) makes it easier to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single local environment. Even if you only need a single version of Node.js right now, we still recommend using nvm because it allows you to switch between different versions of Node (depending on the requirements of your project) with minimal hassle.\\n\\nSo I went ahead and installed nvm locally.\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew uninstall node\\nbrew install nvm\\n```\\n\\nTerminal had to be restarted afterwards.\\n\\nThen I used the newly installed nvm to install Node.js once again.\\n\\n```bash\\nnvm install node\\n```\\n\\n## Installing MetaMask Extension for Chrome ##\\n\\n### What is MetaMask\\n\\n>MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

As a follow-up, I am going to document the steps I took to connect it with the custom domain I had newly purchased.\\n\\nUnder this setup, I would essentially enjoy all the free services that come with a Gmail account (including 15 GB of cloud storage), while having a professional customer-facing email address that ends with the custom domain.\\n\\nAnd if you happen to be in a similar situation with your project, this documentation will hopefully serve as a helpful tutorial for you as well.\\n\\n## Why not just use Google Workspace? ##\\n\\nThe main reason is to cut down on recurring costs, at least at the early stages.\\n\\nGranted, a Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) Business Starter plan will indeed allow you to create a custom business email and get 30 GB cloud storage per user (at the time of this post).\\n\\nPlus, once you have signed up for a Workspace account, you will have the option to create email \u201caliases\u201d \u2014 which will be useful for setting up several different identities / message filters for your brand.\\n\\nAnd for the sake of full disclosure, I do use Google Workspace for my \\\\*main\\\\* company email addresses.\\n\\nHowever, if you are like me and actively run a ton of pet projects, those Workspace plan fees will add up...\\n\\nLet\'s say you have 20 standalone projects that each uses its own domain. Even just the basic Workspace fees would come out to be:\\n\\n$6.00 / user / month x 12 months x 20 projects = $1,440 per year\\n\\nVersus...\\n\\nCost of this setup = $0\\n\\nYou will only need to pay the domain fee on an annual basis.\\n\\n(Side note: And given that this new project is about NFTs, I thought it\'s also worth mentioning that NFT domains \u2014 which you would pay once and own forever \u2014\xa0may soon become more common, and thus further eliminating the recurring fees to \\"rent\\" web2 domains. Perhaps more on that in a future post.)\\n\\n\\n## The goals of my setup ##\\n\\nWhat I was trying to achieve:\\n\\n* Get a **custom domain name** (finalstatic.io) for an annual subscription fee from Google Domains\\n\\n* Sign up for a **free Gmail account** to use with the project (finalstatic.io@gmail.com)\\n\\n* Set up a **custom domain email address for free** (hello@finalstatic.com) via Google Domains, making use of the purchased custom domain\\n\\n* Have emails that are sent to the custom domain email (hello@finalstatic.io) automatically **forwarded to the Gmail account** (finalstatic.io@gmail.com)\\n\\n* **Send email as** hello@finalstatic.io\\n\\n* Eliminate the need to purchase a new Google Workspace account for every new project\\n\\n* Make the most of all the free Google services that come with the Gmail account\\n\\n## Now, the step-by-step guide ##\\n\\n1\\\\. Sign up for a free Gmail account. In my case, it\'s finalstatic.io@gmail.com.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_01-a.png)\\n\\n2\\\\. Purchase a custom domain for your project from Google Domains.\\n\\n![alt text](../2022-03-23-if-you-name-it/final-static_google-domains.png)\\n\\n3\\\\. From Google Domains, set up Email Forwarding: Click on **Add email alias** under the Email tab > type in the alias you want > enter the existing email you want to forward to > click the **Add** button\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_03-a.png)\\n\\nIn my case, I\u2019m trying to have messages sent to hello@finalstatic.io forwarded to my Gmail, finalstatic.io@gmail.com.\\n\\nThe * symbol acts as a wildcard here.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_03-b.png)\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_03-c.png)\\n\\n4\\\\. Confirm your existing email (check your Gmail inbox for the message).\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_04-a.png)\\n\\n_**At this point, you are pretty much good to go!**_\\n\\nAll emails sent to finalstatic.io can now be found in the Gmail inbox of finalstatic.io@gmail.com.\\n\\nSimple as that!\\n\\n## [Optional] ##\\n\\n_**But what if you want to be able to \u201csend\u201d or \u201creply to\u201d emails from your custom email address?**_\\n\\nYou are probably aware that with this setup, you don\'t actually \\"send\\" and \\"receive\\" emails with your custom email (hello@finalstatic.io for me).\\n\\nYou don\'t really touch an inbox or other folders of the custom email.\\n\\nBut thanks to the magic of email forwarding and Gmail alias, you will be able to act as if you are doing just that.\\n\\n### Additional steps to set up the \u201csending from\u201d part:\\n\\n**Part I.** Set up an App Password for your Gmail account to allow you to use the Gmail SMTP servers securely.\\n\\n5\\\\. Go to the Gmail account. Click on your user icon at the upper right corner to bring up the user menu.\\n\\n6\\\\. Click **Manage your Google Account**.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_06-a.png)\\n\\n7\\\\. In the Google Account screen, click on the **Security** tab.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_07-a.png)\\n\\n8\\\\. In the **Signing in to Google** section, click on the **App passwords** bar.\\n\\nYou may be asked to re-enter your password at this point.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_08-a.png)\\n\\n**Note:** You must have **2-Step Verification** enabled for the App passwords option to be available. If it is not, click on **2-Step Verification** and follow the steps to enable 2-Step Verification. Then continue to set the App password.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_08-b.png)\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_08-c.png)\\n\\n9\\\\. In the App passwords box, select **Mail** for the app, select **Other** for the device.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_09-a.png)\\n\\n10\\\\. Enter the name of your domain for the \\"other\\" device, and click Generate.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_10-a.png)\\n\\n11\\\\. The Generated app password box will display a 16-character password. Copy this password. You will need it when you add your new send-as (forwarded) account.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_11-a.png)\\n\\n12\\\\. Return to your Gmail screen.\\n\\n**Part II.** Add the alias as an account to your Gmail inbox.\\n\\n13\\\\. In the top right corner, click the **Settings** button.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_13-a.png)\\n\\n14\\\\. Click the **See all settings** button.\\n\\n15\\\\. In the **Settings** screen, click the **Accounts and Import** tab.\\n\\n16\\\\. Scroll down to **Send mail as** and click **Add another email address**.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_16-a.png)\\n\\n17\\\\. In the first **Add another email address** box, enter the name you want recipients of your email to see (such as \\"Support Team\\" or \\"Sales\\" or any other name for this contact) and the forwarded email address you are setting up.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_17-a.png)\\n\\n18\\\\. Click **Next Step**.\\n\\n**Part III.** Set the Gmail SMTP server as the mail server for your forwarded alias.\\n\\n19\\\\. In the second **Add another email address** box, change the values in fields to enter the following:\\n\\n* **SMTP Server:** `smtp.gmail.com`\\n* **Port:** `465`\\n* **Username:** Your Gmail account (the one you are logged in as)\\n* **Password:** The generated app password you copied in Step 11.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_19-a.png)\\n\\n20\\\\. Click **Add Account**. If you see an error message, check to make sure you have entered the SMTP server, Port, Username, and Password correctly.\\n\\n21\\\\. After you have successfully added the account, return to Gmail. You will see a message from **Gmail Team** with the subject **Gmail Confirmation: Send Mail As** and the address you have just added. Follow the instructions in the message to confirm the email address.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_21-a.png)\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_21-b.png)\\n\\n22\\\\. When you send mail from your Gmail account, click the triangle next to your **From** address to choose to send the message from the account you just added.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_custom-emails_22-a.png)\\n\\nThat\u2019s it!"},{"id":"if-you-name-it","metadata":{"permalink":"/if-you-name-it","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-23-if-you-name-it/index.md","title":"If You Name It","description":"Web3 Code Experiment: Part 1","date":"2022-03-23T17:33:21.000Z","formattedDate":"March 23, 2022","tags":[{"label":"final static","permalink":"/tags/final-static"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"if-you-name-it","title":"If You Name It","date":"2022-03-23 17:33:21 +0800","tags":["final static"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Hook Up Custom Domain Emails to Free Gmail Account","permalink":"/set-up-custom-domain-emails-free"},"nextItem":{"title":"Prototyping Paradigm Shift","permalink":"/prototyping-paradigm-shift"}},"content":"<small>Web3 Code Experiment: Part 1</small>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nWhen we give our pet project a name and identity, we become that much more attached to it and, in turn, may just have a higher likelihood of seeing it through.\\n\\n## The New Project\\n\\nEarlier in the month I got an idea to start \u201cProject NFT Inception\u201d \u2014 a project where I would code up an NFT marketplace for code, which would then sell its own source code.\\n\\nAn idea, of course, doesn\u2019t mean much if there\u2019s no action to back it up. That\u2019s why  the plan is to start building out the prototype as soon as I can. To make the most out of the experience, I am also going to be documenting the entire process every step of the way.\\n\\nWhat you are reading now is essentially the first post of this dedicated blog series by the same moniker.\\n\\n## The Name\\n\\nAs you may have guessed, \u201cProject NFT Inception\u201d is really just a code name. Not too long after coming up with the project idea, I was really stoked to have then thought of an official brand name that I was honestly quite fond of. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you, \u201cFinal Static.\u201d\\n\\nIf you are a fellow developer who has a good grasp of Java, you\u2019ll probably immediately get the meaning behind this name.\\n\\nBut if it isn\u2019t obvious to you, no worries. I\u2019ll break it down below.\\n\\n## Why It\u2019s a Fitting Name\\n\\n```java\\nfinal static\\n```\\n\\n`final` and `static` are both keywords in the Java language. A combination of the two keywords (either `final static` or `static final`) is normally used to define constants in Java. Individually, they each have their own meaning as well.\\n\\nWhen a field is marked `final`, its value is permanent and can\u2019t be modified once assigned.\\n\\nThis is somewhat analogous to how items like smart contracts on the blockchain are immutable.\\n\\nA `static` field means there is ever only one single copy (in other words, just the original) of it. When a field is declared `static`, it remains the same for every instance of the class, and at the same time can also be accessed by pretty much any other classes \u2014 without its class object needing to be instantiated.\\n\\nIn essence, this is very much like how NFT works. While anyone can technically access and download the digital assets, there is ever only one authentic ownership.\\n\\nThe only-ness and permanence are why I thought \u201cFinal Static\u201d would make a great name for an NFT marketplace, given NFT\u2019s nature. In addition, the fact that it is a combination of commonly used programming keywords makes the name all the more appropriate for a marketplace dedicated specifically to computer code.\\n\\nGranted, the two Java keywords have some additional characteristics too. But for the sake of explaining the brand name adoption, I am only listing the ones that draw similarities with NFT source code.\\n\\n## Claim the Domain\\n\\nWith the name locked down, it\u2019s time to purchase a domain name. This part was a no-brainer. I basically just went with one of my usual registrars, Google Domains.\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_google-domains.png)\\n\\nSpeaking of which, if you are reading this post shortly after it\u2019s published, I think I may have a nice surprise for you. Apparently Google Domains has recently moved out of Beta, and I got a celebratory email update from them that came with a discount code.\\n\\nI ought to make it clear that this is not an ad for Google Domains, nor is this post affiliated with them. I am merely including the discount code in case you happened to find it useful. So here goes. In the email it says:\\n\\n> ### Invite your friends\\nHave a friend who hasn\u2019t tried Google Domains yet? New users can enter code **FRIENDSOFDOMAINS** at checkout for 25% off\\\\*\\\\* a new domain or transfer\ufeff-\ufeffin.\\n\\n## The Logo\\n\\nWhen it comes to brand identities, I normally don\u2019t make it a priority to have the \u201cperfect\u201d logo in place. In fact, in almost all past projects, I would just scribble up the first editions myself.\\n\\nHere\u2019s one I made for Final Static in Photoshop:\\n\\n![alt text](./final-static_photoshop-logo.png)\\n\\n## The Email\\n\\nHaving a name at my disposal really helps smoothen the process of getting the wheels rolling. Almost equally important would be an email address. For that purpose, I went on to sign up for a free Gmail account to use for the project.\\n\\nIn the next post, I will go over what I did to hook up the custom domain emails with this new Gmail account.\\n\\n<small>\\\\*\\\\*Google Domains Out of Beta Refer-a-Friend Discount Terms & Conditions</small>\\n\\n<small>Valid for 25% discount, with a maximum redemption value of $10 USD (or the local currency equivalent), against a new or transfer in domain registration price from eligible top level domains on Google Domains.

First and foremost, how fast can the solution be deployed? What corners can be safely cut in order to launch the first version even quicker?\\n\\nIn many ways, it\'s not unlike creating a minimum\xa0viable product (MVP) in pre-COVID times. However, there is less tolerance for error in what we choose to release now. Also, effectiveness should come before aesthetics.\\n\\n2\\\\. What materials or resources are required for deployment? Would reliance on them lead to a new wave of shortages? And if so, are there any feasible alternatives?\\n\\n3\\\\. How many people can benefit from the solution? If there is potential to boost that number now or in the future, then excellent! Ultimately though, helping \\\\*someone\\\\* is better than helping \\\\*no one\\\\*.\\n\\nIn other words, avoid dwelling on this question for too long. Go ahead and implement your prototype even if it will only be helpful to a small group of people at the beginning.\\n\\n4\\\\. How well will the solution scale? Is there room for expansions or even spin-offs when this is all over? If so, great!\\n\\nLike #3 though, go ahead regardless. After all, the priority here is to defeat the pandemic. Besides, just as in normal times, a product for everyone is a product for no one.\\n\\n5\\\\. What are some financing options? Whilst I don\'t recommend profiting off of commercializing anti-COVID solutions, there are quite a few funding streams that will help accelerate the realization of your social missions.

Existing for about 100 years from as early as 1865 until 1968, the laws were intended to \\"restore\\" Southern states to a pre-war class structure by marginalizing African Americans, some of whom were freed slaves.\\n\\nBlack codes were dictated as a legal way to put black citizens into servitude \u2014 taking their voting rights away, controlling where they were allowed to live and work, and how they traveled. The list goes on.\\n\\nIn Montgomery, Alabama, segregation mandated that the front of a bus be reserved for white residents only, and the seats in the back rows for black residents.\\n\\nRosa Parks (1913 - 2005) had had enough. She was tired. No, not physically tired. She said she was tired of giving in.\\n\\nOn December 1, 1955, Parks chose to stand up for herself and other African Americans by \u2014 interestingly enough \u2014 remaining seated. On her commute home from work, the \\"white\\" section on the bus was full. The bus driver told Parks to give up her seat in the \\"colored\\" section for a white man. Parks refused.\\n\\nMoments later, two police officers approached the bus, arrested Parks and placed her in custody.\\n\\nOn December 5, Parks was found guilty of violating segregation laws in court. She was fined and given a suspended sentence.\\n\\nHer conviction helped initiate the civil rights movement. Black community leaders organized a 381-day bus boycott \u2014 led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 during which Parks lost her job and experienced year-long harassment.\\n\\nThe boycott would only come to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional.\\n\\nWe don\'t all have to be \\"the mother of the civil rights movement.\\"\\n\\nBut remember this: Every conscious decision we make as a community, everything we did (or didn\'t do) collectively on any given day, will inescapably be written into history, forever.\\n\\nWhen future generations look back, some events will seem utterly ridiculous to them, some remarkable.\\n\\nStand up for what you believe is right \u2014 even if you are literally sitting down, like Rosa Parks was."},{"id":"acknowledge-its-existence","metadata":{"permalink":"/acknowledge-its-existence","source":"@site/blog/2019-08-16-acknowledge-its-existence.md","title":"Acknowledge Its Existence","description":"Summary: Know that it\'s there even if we can\'t see it \u2014 especially if we can\'t see it.","date":"2019-08-16T03:56:21.000Z","formattedDate":"August 16, 2019","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"acknowledge-its-existence","title":"Acknowledge Its Existence","date":"2019-08-16 03:56:21 +0800"},"prevItem":{"title":"Stand Up by Sitting Down","permalink":"/stand-up-by-sitting-down"},"nextItem":{"title":"Likelihood","permalink":"/likelihood"}},"content":"<small>Summary: Know that it\'s there even if we can\'t see it \u2014 *especially* if we can\'t see it.</small>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nToday\'s late-night ramblings are in regard to something that one cannot see, but undoubtedly exists nonetheless.\\n\\nAre you thinking what I was thinking?
